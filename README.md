# GIAPY: Glacial Isostatic Adjustment in PYthon

This is an opensource python package in development for copmuting
the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment of the surface of the earth in response to
shifting surface loads and comparing it to geophysical data. 
The method used here is based principally on that of Cathles (1975). 

## Dependencies
numpy : Numerical computing package

numba : (optional) Provides a just in time compiler for faster computation.
