This package provides the classes and functions necessary for calculating
the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment of the earth and comparing it to geophysical
data. The method being developed is principally that of Cathles (1975), though
I hope to expand this in future.

A note on UNITS (unless otherwise specified):
    Time - time is measured in thousand years before present (cal ka bp),
    meaning positive times are in the past.

    Length - Length is usually specified in the individual modules, but
    there are a few regulars:
        distances along globe            : km
        uplift, geoid, ice heights, etc. : m

    Viscosity - in 10^21 Pa s

    Flexural Rigidity - in 10^23 N m
