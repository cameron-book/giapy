# GIAPY: Glacial Isostatic Adjustment in PYthon

This package provides the classes and functions necessary for calculating
the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment of the surface of the earth in response to
shifting surface loads and comparing it to geophysical data. The method being 
developed is based principally on that of Cathles (1975). 

The primary computation occus in ```giapy.giasim```, which is responsible for 
combing loads and earth models to compute responses. The method is a spherical,
gravitationally-consistent, with a redistributing ocean load that obeys shifting
coastlines. There are modules for manipulating ice models (```giapy.ice```), for 
computing the response to harmonic loads (```giapy.earth```), and for data 
integration (```giapy.data```).

DEPENDENCIES
basemap : this package does the majority of the geographic plotting and provides 
            some useful tools for dealing with geographic data.
numba   : Provides a just in time compiler for faster computation.
emcee   : The MCMC Hammer. Affine invariant MCMC algorithm.

A note on UNITS (unless otherwise specified):
    Time - time is measured in thousand years before present (cal ka bp),
    meaning positive times are in the past.

    Length - Length is usually specified in the individual modules, but
    there are a few regulars:
        distances along globe            : km
        uplift, geoid, ice heights, etc. : m

    Viscosity - in 10^21 Pa s

    Flexural Rigidity - in 10^23 N m
